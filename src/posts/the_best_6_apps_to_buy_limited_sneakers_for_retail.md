# The Best 6 Apps to Buy Limited Sneakers for Retail

When it comes to limited sneaker releases, you need two things to secure your grail. Luck or a bot, maybe even both. However, not everyone can afford to pay thousands of dollars for [sneaker bots](https://www.businessinsider.com/sneaker-bots-how-to-buy-make-and-run-the-tech-2021-1) and learn to use them properly. Luckily there are still some applications where regular people can stand a chance to cop sought-after pairs.

Luck is a crucial factor, but it is also essential to gather information on a specific release. There are many brands with different methods, so you have to know when, where, and how the release will go down to maximize your odds. The applications that I mention in this article are my go-to places for limited releases since I experienced the highest chances of buying something on these platforms.

The SNKRS App gives home to Nike's most coveted sneaker and clothing releases. The release method varies. Usually, it's either "LEO," where you have approximately 2-3 minutes to enter, or a "DAN" where the raffle is open for 15 minutes. Other than that, Nike often hands out exclusive or early access, which grants access to a specific shoe for some of its lucky users. From time to time, they even do shock drops and "interactive" releases for some of their products through the app.

The Nike App is almost like Nike's web store in the form of an app. You can purchase general products and sometimes less limited but hyped items like Dunks and Jordan 1 Mids. In that case, the method of release is similar to the "LEO" method. You can use the same account for both the SNKRS and the Nike App.

Lately, Adidas has shifted their Yeezy releases from their website to their applications. Most of their limited releases take place in the Confirmed App in the form of draws. These draws last for days, but I've seen them last only for 30 minutes, so it's worth turning on notifications. Just like Nike, Adidas sometimes hands out exclusive access to its users. Unluckily, the Confirmed App only supports certain countries. To find out whether your country is supported, you have to look it up in your device's app store.

Limited releases less often take place in the Adidas App, and it mainly offers the same products as Adidas' website. However, I'd not be surprised to see some hyped items dropping since I've seen in-store reservations popping up for Yeezys here. The Adidas App is more widely available than the Confirmed App, but there are still plenty of countries that it doesn't support.

Sneakersnstuff is a Swedish store established in 1999. There you can find the latest hard-to-find sneaker releases such as Adidas YEEZY and Nike x Off-White Collections. They get almost every limited release, and what's better is that they have an app where you can participate in raffles for those products.

Size? has been in the sneaker business since 2000. Their Size? Launches app serves the sole purpose of running raffles for limited kicks. However, they take the money in advance, and if you don't win the raffle, they refund it. This isn't as bad as it sounds since this method ensures that bots don't make their raffles unfair.
